Right Now, They need a Helping Hand :(
Rants here, there and everywhere. Can we please stop this nonsense and just show our support to our government? 
Reading some blogs about the supertyphoon. It's feeding my mind how abusive and corrupt the PHL gov. can be.
Kung walang kwenta ang gobyerno, ano ka pa?
Tacloban still makes me cry
Grabe na ang damage ni #Yolanda ! Namatay-4,919 Nawawala-1,000+ Nasugatan-25,000+
Mas madalas naten makita ang press briefing kesa sa ginagawang aksyon
OMG! Watching Typhoon Yolandas videos on Youtube made me cry. I'm so speechless. I pray for speedy recovery of our country
Iringan dito, iringan duon. Yan tayo mga Pinoy! Aasenso tayo nyan!
Feeling soo speechless when 1 of our customer asked me how was philippines?
This is like a scene in World War Z. Survivors are running for Relief Goods

Heartbreaking stories

PH Govt: Blaming, instead of helping
'Yung masakit pa rin sa puso 'yung mapapanood mo.
Kaiyak balita sa CNN
All these stories of faith and hope from those that suffered most make my heart swell with pride and my eyes, with tears
My heart breaks for our countrymen
Throwback: Damage brought by typhoon Yolanda/Haiyan in VSULHS

While watching @bandila nakakatindig balahibo ung mga sigawan ng mga Victims ni #YolandaPH
When I saw this commercial of a Filipino raising the Philippine flag in Tacloban, I wanted to cry jud
Napa-iyak akooooo
A story from the disaster zone.
Nakakaloka naman yung mga armed men na nang gulo pa sa Tacloban. Hirap na nga yung mga tao, dinagdagan pa patayan
Damages in the Busuanga Airport, Palawan
How about Jaro, #Leyte ? Anybody has a contact person there? We need information
13,021 classrooms in need of repair for Yolanda-affected areas.
Just a bad day not a bad life
Despite of all the help we're getting all over the world, why is it that many more victims are still starving?
In a span of one month, a lot happened in the Philippines. From earthquake, tornado to typhoon.
